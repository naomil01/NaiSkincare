# NaiSkincare

## Description
PROJECT 3 ðŸ“Š  - I designed a skincare brand called NaiSkincare and implemented a database in MySQL to leverage insights into which products are selling the most and in which countries. The aim was to optimise product offerings and marketing strategies based on gathered data. 
In addition , to understand my customers' demographics and purchasing behaviours to tailor my marketing advertisements effectively to the appropriate target audience.
